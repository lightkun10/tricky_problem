# tricky_problem
When doing the AppAcademy Online free class, some of the problem sets still trips me over because my crackhead is bad at memorizing syntax or translating a problem into program in general.

So, I decided to docomenting them in a single repo, so I could come back over and over again to read and memorizing their pattern in any real situation.
